# Engineering Foundations & Python Lab

This repository documents my journey moving from beginner to software engineer. It contains my notes, exercises, and projects as I master Python, Linux, and Software Engineering principles.

## Curriculum Followed
* **Harvard CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python):** Lecture notes and solutions to Problem Sets.
* **MIT "The Missing Semester":** Shell scripting, Git, and Vim.

## Structure
### Phase 1: The Base (Python & Tools)
* `phase-1/0-functions-variables/`: Inputs, strings, and integer math (CS50P Week 0).
* `phase-1/1-conditionals/`: Logic gates (`if`, `elif`, `match`) and decision making (CS50P Week 1).
